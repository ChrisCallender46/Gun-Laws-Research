In this project, which I completed for my Econometrics class at Quinnipiac, I researched factors that affect gun violence rates. I determined that stand your ground laws, income, education, unemployment, divorce rate, and race all affect gun violence rates. Tests were conducted to detect if heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity, and serial correlation were present.
